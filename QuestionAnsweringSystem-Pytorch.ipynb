Fire tablet owners get free, unlimited photo storage, in full resolution, for all of their photos taken with their Fire tablet. Do I have to register my Fire tablet to get free unlimited photo storage from Amazon Drive? Yes. You will have to register your Fire tablet with your Amazon account to enjoy this benefit. Will my original photos be uploaded? Yes. Your photos will be uploaded and saved in your Amazon Drive account as-is. Can I upload just photos? No. When you turn on Auto-Save, your Fire tablet will upload both photos and videos. What happens to my video uploads when I go over my Amazon Drive storage limit? When you go over your storage limit, your Fire tablet will not upload your videos. Photos taken with your Fire tablet will continue to be uploaded and will not count against your storage limit. You can buy more storage or delete existing content on Amazon Drive to make room for videos to upload. I want to give my Fire tablet to my daughter. Will she get unlimited photo storage? Yes, your daughter will get the unlimited storage benefit when she registers the Fire tablet with her Amazon account. Will I lose the photos and videos that I have previously uploaded when I give away my Fire tablet? No. You can continue to view and download your photos and videos uploaded from your Fire tablet from Amazon Drive. When you buy a new Fire tablet, the uploaded photos and videos from your previous Fire tablet will be available on your new Fire tablet when you register your device with your Amazon account. I am an existing Amazon Drive customer; will I get unlimited photo storage for my new Fire tablet? Yes. When you register your new Fire tablet, you will automatically enjoy unlimited storage for all the photos you take with your new Fire tablet. Your Amazon Drive account will reflect this new benefit. Additional Terms &amp; Conditions. The unlimited photo storage benefit (the \"Benefit\") is not transferable, exchangeable or redeemable for cash and only applies to photos taken and uploaded from a Fire tablet registered to your Amazon account. Your use of the Benefit is subject to the [Cloud Drive Terms of Use](http://www.amazon.com/cd/tou). Void where prohibited by law.

Yes, your daughter will get the unlimited storage benefit when she registers the Fire tablet with her Amazon account.

I am an existing Amazon Drive customer; will I get unlimited photo storage for my new Fire tablet? Yes. When you register your new Fire tablet, you will automatically enjoy unlimited storage for all the photos you take with your new Fire tablet. Your Amazon Drive account will reflect this new benefit.

Contact your bank directly to solve these payment issues. To retry a declined payment, go to [Your Orders](www.amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history).

Did you enter your credit card number, credit card expiration date, billing address, and phone number correctly in [Your Account](www.amazon.com/youraccount)? Is your purchase outside of your normal spending range? Some banks will block transactions due to security concerns. Does your issuing bank have special policies regarding electronic or internet purchases? To retry a declined payment: Go to [Your Orders](www.amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history). Do one of the following: Try again with a different payment method, as follows: Select Change Payment Method next to the order you want to modify.

If the item doesn't have an exchange option or you received the item as a gift, you'll need to return the original item and place a new order. To exchange an item: Go to [Your Orders](www.amazon.com/gp/css/order-history) and select Return or replace items beside the item you want to exchange. Tip: If you don't see the order you're looking for, select the date on which you placed the order from the drop-down menu in the upper part of the page. Select the item you want to exchange, and select a reason from the Reason for return menu.  An exchange order will be created with the same shipping speed that was used on your original item. Use the return label provided to send your original item back. Return the original item within 30 days to avoid being charged for both the original and exchange items. This policy refers to color and size exchanges only. Amazon doesn't price match. If the item you're exchanging costs less than your original purchase, we'll refund you the difference. If the new item costs more, we'll charge you for the difference in price. For details on what types of items can be exchanged, see [Exchanges and Replacements](www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYG97JCDCUNGURQJ).   \n",

The following are common scenarios for unknown charges: An Amazon Prime yearly subscription was renewed. For more information, go to [Manage Your Prime Membership](www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/account/homepage.html?ie=UTF8&ref_=nav_youraccount_prime). A bank has placed an authorization hold for recently canceled or changed orders. When you place an order, Amazon contacts the issuing bank to confirm the validity of the payment method. Your bank reserves the funds until the transaction processes or the authorization expires, but this isn't an actual charge. If you cancelled your order, the authorization will be removed from your account according to the policies of your bank. To remove an authorization, contact your bank to clarify how long they hold authorizations for online orders. An order was placed by a family member, friend, or co-worker with access to your card number. Additional cards are associated with the credit or debit account. A back-ordered or pre-ordered item shipped. A gift order shipped. An order placed outside Amazon.com using Amazon Pay. Amazon Pay orders begin with ‘P01’ and are followed by 14 digits. Check your Amazon Pay Account for your order history. For further assistance with any Amazon Pay transactions, see the Amazon Pay Help pages. An order was split into multiple shipments or sent to multiple shipping addresses. Note: This appears on your statement as separate charges. If the charge isn't explained by any of these situations, contact us by phone and have the following information available: Date of the charge. Amount of the charge. Your name, email address, and phone number. Charge ID, a unique 9-digit alphanumeric code that Customer Service can use to locate your charge, e.g., Amazon.com*A123B4CD5, Prime Now*B123B4CD5, AMZN Mktp US*C123B4CD5. Note: This ID only appears when the card is charged. It is not present on Pending charges (Authorizations). Use your order history to review your orders and shipments to compare the charges with the charges on your bank statement..Cancel Subscribe with Amazon Subscriptions: You can cancel your Subscribe with Amazon subscriptions at any time from Your Memberships and Subscriptions in Your Account. To cancel a subscription you purchased using Subscribe with Amazon: Go to [Your Memberships and Subscriptions](https://www.amazon.com/yourmembershipsandsubscriptions). Select Manage Subscription next to the subscription you'd like to cancel. Click the link under Advance Controls to be directed to the main subscription page. From this page, you can end your subscription. About Cancellations and Refunds for Digital Subscriptions. Once you cancel, the renewal date in your subscription details becomes the end date. You'll no longer be charged for the subscription, but can continue to access it until this date. You can cancel a subscription at any time, with no early termination fees. For subscriptions with a renewal period longer than one month, new subscribers are eligible for a full refund if they cancel within 7 days of purchase. Access to the subscription is removed as soon as a refund is issued. Outside of the refund window, or for subscriptions with a billing period one month or less in length, cancellation turns off auto-renew for the subscription so you won't be billed again. Once you cancel you will still have access to the subscription through the end of your current paid billing period. For subscriptions with a billing period of 6 months or longer, or when otherwise required by law, we'll notify you when the subscription is set to renew. You can then change your billing information or cancel your subscription before you're charged again. Note: To learn more about auto-renewals, go to [About Auto-Renewal for Subscribe with Amazon Subscriptions (Digital Subscriptions Only)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=202013370). About Cancellations for Physical Subscriptions. Once you cancel, no further orders will be placed. You will not be charged until the order ships. Cancelling a subscription does not cancel any pending unshipped order. To cancel pending unshipped orders, you can go to Your Orders and request cancellation\"\n",
